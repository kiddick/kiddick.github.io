&lt;p&gt;I've decided to reboot my blog!
Since I'm trying to learn some javascript I need some real practice with it.
I should at the same time learn and refresh some basics HTML and CSS.
So I'll try to build theme and other stuff for this blog from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah it is probably :) ugly for now. But I'll do my best!
So additionally I'll try to write more articles with different topics cuz I need some practice in english too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May be som enotes with rules, etc.
Just need to write a liitle bit more than just a couple of words!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, I am trying to remember some good words to express though with meaning - stay with me, but I cant. Something like dont lose attention or don't go further from reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in general it is at the same fun and hard to express thoughts in english.
Sometimes seems what I have a really poor vocabulary but as I suppose writing is a one way how I can improve that skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, kiddick.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thoughts"></category></entry></feed>
